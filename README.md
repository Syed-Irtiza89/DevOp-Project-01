# 🚀 Nexus Ops - Frontend DevOps Dashboard Demo

Welcome to my personal project! I built **Nexus Ops** as a **UI/UX demonstration** to show how a modern DevOps dashboard could look and feel. **Note: This is a front-end demo meant for portfolio display; it uses simulated data and mock terminal logs.**

## 🧐 Why I built this
I've been learning about DevOps and I realized that most production tools (like Prometheus or Datadog) can be really overwhelming for beginners. I wanted to see if I could build a cleaner, more "modern" looking interface that highlights only the most important metrics.

## ✨ Cool Stuff in this Project
- **Live Terminal (Simulation)**: If you click on any of the active pipelines, you'll see a terminal stream that simulates build and deployment logs.
- **Cluster Monitoring**: I added a section to track K8s clusters and storage usage with some basic "Critical Alert" logic.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: I spent a lot of time on the CSS to make sure it looks premium and sleek (lots of blur and transparency!).

## 🛠 What I used
- **React 18** & **Vite** (Super fast dev experience)
- **Lucide Icons** (For those clean UI icons)
- **Vanila CSS** (I didn't use Tailwind here because I wanted full control over the glassmorphism effects)

## 🏗 How to run it locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Hit `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and go to the port shown in your terminal!

*Note: This is a work in progress. I'm planning to add a real backend later to pull in actual AWS or Docker data!*
